# Group Cerf - 7CCSMGPR, Dept. of Informatics, KCL 
 
This organisation holds repositories made during the 7CCSMGPR module, by Group Cerf. 

- The `RequestEcho` repo is the main repo which contains the web application as well as the backend API.
- The `ml` repo contains the code that allows users to perform the machine learning operations on the requests which are used by the backend.
- We have auxiliary repositories like the `scrapper` and the `data-cleaning` repo which were used in the process of creating of Request Echo but are not directly tied to the solution.
